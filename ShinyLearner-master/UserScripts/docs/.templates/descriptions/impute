The `--impute` argument is set to `false` by default. When set to `true`, missing values will be imputed. In input data files, missing values should be specified as ?, NA, or null. Median-based imputation will be used for continuous and integer variables. Mode-based imputation will be used for discrete variables. Any variable missing more than 50% of values across all samples will be removed. Subsequently, any sample missing more than 50% of values across all features will be removed.
